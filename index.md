I am an MSc student at the [University of the Witwatersrand](https://www.wits.ac.za/), Johannesburg, South Africa, under the supervision of [Prof. Benjamin Rosman](https://www.benjaminrosman.com/) and [Dr. Ritesh Ajoodha](https://www.riteshajoodha.co.za/), and a member of the [Robotics, Autonomous Intelligence and Learning Lab](https://www.raillab.org/).

My research interests are mainly in the field of assisted reinforcement learning, including interactive reinforcement learning and human-agent interaction. I am also interested more generally in reinforcement learning and ethical and safe artificial intelligence.
