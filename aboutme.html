<h1 id="home">About Me</h1>
<p>As a student and researcher in Assisted Reinforcment Learning, I am passionate about the possibility of humans and autonomous agents interacting. I am particularly interested in understanding how humans (who are messy and complicated) can be made sense of by an agent, and how we as humans can adapt the way we teach and collaborate with agents.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I am a semi-professional trombonist who regularly plays with the Phoenix Big Band, and have collaborated with the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra and Rand Symphony Orchestra. I also dabble in the Guitar, Penny Whistle and Bodhran, as well as a few other instruments I have lying around.</p>

<p>My other interests include cooking, baking, history, sustainable living and mutual aid.</p>
