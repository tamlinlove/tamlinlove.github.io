<dt>Learning Who to Trust: Policy Learning in Single-Stage Decision Problems with Unreliable Expert Advice</dt>
<dd><i>Currently under peer review</i></dd>
<dd>Assisted Reinforcement Learning in a Single-Stage Decision Problem setting, in which multiple, potentially unreliable experts advise an RL agent while it learns. This paper introduces the CLUE algorithm, which models the reliability of each expert and uses it to determine whether or not advice should be followed. Results indicate that CLUE benefits from good experts, but is robust against bad experts.</dd>
