    <td>Work in the field of Assisted Reinforcement Learning (ARL)
has shown that the incorporation of external information in
problem solving can greatly increase the rate at which learners
can converge to an optimal policy and aid in scaling algorithms
to larger, more complex problems. However, these approaches
rely on a single, reliable source of information; the
problem of learning with information from multiple and/or
unreliable sources of information is still an open question in
ARL. We present CLUE (Cautiously Learning with Unreliable
Experts), a framework for learning single-stage decision
problems with policy advice from multiple, potentially unreliable
experts.We compare CLUE against an unassisted agent
and an agent that na¨ıvely follows advice, and our results show
that CLUE exhibits faster convergence than an unassisted
agent when advised by reliable experts, but is nevertheless
robust against incorrect advice from unreliable experts.</td>
