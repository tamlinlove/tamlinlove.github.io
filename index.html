<p>I am a sessional lecturer at the <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/">University of the Witwatersrand</a>, Johannesburg, South Africa. I was previously a MSc student at the same institution under the supervision of <a href="https://www.benjaminrosman.com/">Prof. Benjamin Rosman</a> and <a href="https://www.riteshajoodha.co.za/">Dr. Ritesh Ajoodha</a>. I am also an active member of the <a href="https://www.raillab.org/">Robotics, Autonomous Intelligence and Learning Lab</a>.</p>
<p>I am very interested in the intersection of humans and intelligent systems, particularly robots and reinforcement learning agents. I believe interaction between humans and machines can be beneficial for both parties, with humans assisting agents in learning (e.g. assisted RL) and robots assisting humans in particular tasks (e.g. social robotics). More generally, I am also interested in ethical, explainable and safe implementations of these systems.</p>
