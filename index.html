<p>I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.iri.upc.edu/">Institut de Robotica i Informàtica Industrial (IRI)</a> (under <a href="https://www.csic.es/en">CSIC</a> and <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en">UPC</a>) in Barcelona, working on the <a href="https://www.iri.upc.edu/project/show/29">TRAIL</a> Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Network under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/galenya/">Guillem Alenyà</a></p>.
<p>I obtained my MSc at the <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/">University of the Witwatersrand</a> in Johannesburg, South Africa, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.benjaminrosman.com/">Benjamin Rosman</a> and <a href="https://www.riteshajoodha.co.za/">Ritesh Ajoodha</a>. From 2022 - 2023 I worked as a sessional lecturer at the same institution. I am also a research associate of the <a href="https://www.raillab.org/">Robotics, Autonomous Intelligence and Learning Lab (RAIL)</a>.</p>
<p>I am very interested in the intersection of humans and intelligent systems, particularly robots and reinforcement learning agents. I believe interaction between humans and machines can be beneficial for both parties, with humans assisting agents in learning (e.g. assisted RL) and robots assisting humans in particular tasks (e.g. social robotics). More generally, I am also interested in ethical, explainable and safe implementations of these systems.</p>
