<p>I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.iri.upc.edu/">Institut de Robotica i Informàtica Industrial (IRI)</a> (under <a href="https://www.csic.es/en">CSIC</a> and <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en">UPC</a>) in Barcelona, working on the <a href="https://www.iri.upc.edu/project/show/29">TRAIL</a> Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Network under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/galenya/">Guillem Alenyà</a>, in the <a href="https://www.iri.upc.edu/research/perception">Perception and Manipulation</a> group.</p>
<p>I obtained my MSc at the <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/">University of the Witwatersrand</a> in Johannesburg, South Africa, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.benjaminrosman.com/">Benjamin Rosman</a> and <a href="https://www.riteshajoodha.co.za/">Ritesh Ajoodha</a>. From 2022 - 2023 I worked as a sessional lecturer at the same institution. I am also a research associate of the <a href="https://www.raillab.org/">Robotics, Autonomous Intelligence and Learning Lab (RAIL)</a>.</p>
<p>My main interests are in exploring how humans and intelligent systems interact, be it thorugh collaboration, assistance or learning. To that end, I am also very interested in how representations of environments and actors (such as humans) can facilitate these interactions, through transparent and explainable models that allow an agent to adapt to tasks and people. Related issues of AI ethics, safety and explainability are also important to me.</p>
