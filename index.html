<p>I am a sessional lecturer at the <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/">University of the Witwatersrand</a>, Johannesburg, South Africa. I was previously a MSc student at the same institution under the supervision of <a href="https://www.benjaminrosman.com/">Prof. Benjamin Rosman</a> and <a href="https://www.riteshajoodha.co.za/">Dr. Ritesh Ajoodha</a>. I am also an active member of the <a href="https://www.raillab.org/">Robotics, Autonomous Intelligence and Learning Lab</a>.</p>
<p>My research interests are mainly in the field of assisted reinforcement learning, including interactive reinforcement learning and human-agent interaction. I am also interested more generally in reinforcement learning and ethical and safe artificial intelligence.</p>
